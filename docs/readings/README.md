# Papers

Here are few articles about methods currently used for accident investigation. These papers don't explicitely deal with a cognitive approach of the problem. They don't propose a model of how one might operate backward induction from the outcome _accident_ to the underlying network of causes. But they present some interesting and technical operational methods usually used.

For a general overwiew:
* Sklet 2004
* Hulme 2019 (compares with each other and discusses several methods)

For a more precise exemple of method of investigation applied to aircraft accident:
* Zotov 2011

From a psychological point of view:
* Benner 1975
* Benner 1978

About the interaction between human and system:
* Lee 2018 (for accident analysis).
* Adriaensen 2019 (more generally)
