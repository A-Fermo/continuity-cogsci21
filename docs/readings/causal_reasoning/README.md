# Papers

Here are few articles about methods currently used for accident investigation. These papers don't explicitely deal with a cognitive approach of the problem. They don't propose a model of how one might operate backward induction from the outcome _accident_ to the underlying network of causes. But they present some intersting and technical operational methods usually used.

For a more general overwiew of these methods:
* Sklet 2004
* Hulme 2019

For a more precise exemple of method of investigation applied to aircraft accident:
* Zotov 2011

From a psychological point of view:
* Benner 1975
* Benner 1978

The other articles aim to compare some methods with each other or evaluate the interaction between human an system in accident analysis (see for instance Lee 20018).
